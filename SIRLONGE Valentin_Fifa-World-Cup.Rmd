## **Presentation of the Databases**
This analysis is based on two datasets that provide complementary insights into the history of the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA world rankings.
\

#### **1. FIFA World Cup Historical Data**
The first dataset contains historical **FIFA World Cup** data, including details on *years*, *host countries*, *champions*, *number of goals*, *average goals per game*, and *participating teams*.

```{r Dataset,echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("FIFA World Cup.csv")
ranking <- read.csv("fifa_ranking_2022-10-06.csv")
```

**Key columns:**

* **YEAR** : The year of the tournament.
* **HOST** : The host country of the event.
* **CHAMPION** : The country that won the World Cup.
* **RUNNER.UP** : The country that finished second in the World Cup.

* **GOALS.SCORED** : The total goals scored in the tournament.
* **AVG.GOALS.PER.GAME** : The average number of goals scored per match.
* **RANK** : Rank countries performances by year. 
\
\

#### **2. FIFA World Rankings Data**
The second dataset contains **FIFA World Rankings 2022 data**. It highlights the performance of national teams worldwide, based on their ranking, points, and confederation.

This dataset enables us to analyze the distribution of points, compare rankings across confederations, and identify dominant teams in global football.
\

**Key columns:**

* **TEAM** : The name of the national team.
* **TEAM_CODE** : A code that identifies each team.
* **RANK** : The team's rank as of October 2022.
* **PREVIOUS_RANK** : The team's rank in the previous ranking period.
* **POINTS** : The total points achieved by the team.
* **PREVIOUS_POINTS** : The points in the previous ranking period.
* **ASSOCIATION** : The confederation to which the team belongs (e.g., UEFA, CONMEBOL).

## **Graphical Analysis**
\

#### Goals Analysis
\

```{r Total Goals per Edition, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE}
goals_by_year <- data %>% 
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Goals = sum(GOALS.SCORED))

ggplot(goals_by_year, aes(x = YEAR, y = Total_Goals)) +
  geom_col(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Total Goals Scored per FIFA World Cup Edition",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Goals Scored"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
\
\

This chart shows the **evolution of the total number of goals scored** during various FIFA World Cup editions since 1925. A ***general upward trend*** is observed, with ***significant fluctuations in the early years*** and ***stabilization starting in the 1970s***. The ***highest scores are achieved after 2000***, potentially reflecting ***changes in game rules, increased participation, or improvements in offensive strategies***. Variations between editions could also be explained by the ***competition format*** or the ***number of participating teams***.
\
\
\
\

```{r Average Goals per Match,echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = YEAR, y = AVG.GOALS.PER.GAME)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Goals per Match Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Goals per Match"
  ) +
  theme_light()
```
\
\

This chart shows the **average number of goals scored per match** over time during FIFA World Cup tournaments. The data reveals a ***significant peak in 1954***, with ***more than five goals per match***, followed by a ***gradual decline to around three goals per match*** by the 1970s. Since then, the average has remained ***relatively stable, with minor fluctuations***. This downward trend could reflect ***changes in football strategies, defensive improvements, or rule modifications***. The ***consistent stabilization in recent years*** suggests a ***balance between offense and defense in modern football***.

hosts_split <- hosts %>%
  mutate(HOST = strsplit(as.character(HOST), ", ")) %>%  
  unnest(HOST)  

hosts_split$HOST <- trimws(hosts_split$HOST)  
hosts_split$HOST[hosts_split$HOST == "United States"] <- "USA"
hosts_split$HOST[hosts_split$HOST == "Korea Republic"] <- "South Korea"
hosts_split$HOST[hosts_split$HOST == "West Germany"] <- "Germany"
hosts_split$HOST[hosts_split$HOST == "England"] <- "UK"

world_map <- map_data("world")

world_map <- world_map %>%
  mutate(is_host = ifelse(region %in% hosts_split$HOST, "Host Country", "Other Country"))

ggplot(world_map, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = is_host), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```
\
\

This map highlights the **countries that have hosted the FIFA World Cup**. ***Host countries are shown in red***, while ***non-host countries are displayed in grey***.

#### Participating Teams
\

```{r Number of Teams Over Time, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = YEAR, y = TEAMS)) +
  geom_line(color = "green", size = 1.2) +

```
\
\

This chart shows the **number of participating teams in FIFA World Cups** over time. The data reveals ***a steady increase in the number of teams***, with ***major expansions occurring in the 1980s and 1990s***. Initially, the tournaments featured ***fewer than 20 teams***, but by the 2000s, the number stabilized at ***32 teams***. These expansions likely reflect ***the growing popularity of football*** and ***efforts to include more countries from different regions***. The consistent participation since the 2000s highlights the ***standardization of tournament formats*** in modern FIFA World Cups.

#### Host Countries Winning the World Cup
\

```{r Host Countries Winning, echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error=FALSE}
host_champions <- data %>%
  mutate(Host_Champion = ifelse(HOST == CHAMPION, "Won at Home", "Did Not Win at Home")) %>%
  group_by(Host_Champion) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

host_champions <- host_champions %>%
  mutate(Percentage = round((Count / sum(Count)) * 100, 1))

ggplot(host_champions, aes(x = 2, y = Count, fill = Host_Champion)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  xlim(1.5, 2.5) +  
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, "%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "white", size = 5) +
